# Car_Model_Recognition
Object Classification model to identify the model of a car 
Task
“To build an image recognition model which is capable of identifying the Model of a Car from an image”

•	For building the Image recognition model we will follow these following steps:
Step 1:  Creating & Reading the dataset 
	A: Writing Scrapper for downloading the Car images
	B: Maintaining A CSV file for better preprocessing 
Step 2: Preprocess and analyze the dataset (Check for shape, Total Number of labels, Column content overview)
Step 3: Drop the Unnecessary columns and preprocessed the dataset
Step 4: Assign the class weights for labels and divide the dataset in training, validation and testing parts 
Step 5: Define the density, activation function for training the model using keras Tensorflow
Step 6: Now validate the model and store the results in csv files
Step 7: Visualizations of the results
